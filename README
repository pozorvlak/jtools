jtools - simple command-line utilities for working with JSON.


INSTALLATION

Install Makamaka Hannyaharamitu's JSON module from CPAN:

$ cpan JSON

Copy jd and jf to somewhere in your PATH:

$ cp jd jf ~/bin

That's it.

USAGE

Both jd and jf behave like standard Unix filters: they take text on standard
input (or from files specified on the command-line), operate on it, and dump
the result to standard output.

jd simply pretty-prints its output:

$ echo '{"nemeses":{"batman":"joker", "harry":"voldemort"}}' | jd
{
   "nemeses" : {
      "batman" : "joker",
      "harry" : "voldemort"
   }
}

jf accepts a series of XPath-like field specifications, and returns only those
parts of its input, preserving as much structure as necessary. With the -p
option it will pretty-print its output.

$ curl -s -upozorvlak:<my password here> http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/mentions.json | jf -p user/name user/screen_name text
[
   {
      "text" : "@pozorvlak I have to admit that if you have polymorphism then things like +. are particularly pointless.",
      "user" : {
         "name" : "Christopher Yocum",
         "screen_name" : "cyocum"
      }
   },
   {
      "text" : "@pozorvlak Huh, I still like the safety that static typing gives you.",
      "user" : {
         "name" : "Christopher Yocum",
         "screen_name" : "cyocum"
      }
   }
... etc ...
]

Or from a file:

jf -p user/name user/screen_name text -- one_I_prepared_earlier 
[
   {
      "text" : "@pozorvlak I have to admit that if you have polymorphism then things like +. are particularly pointless.",
      "user" : {
         "name" : "Christopher Yocum",
         "screen_name" : "cyocum"
      }
   },
   {
      "text" : "@pozorvlak Huh, I still like the safety that static typing gives you.",
      "user" : {
         "name" : "Christopher Yocum",
         "screen_name" : "cyocum"
      }
   }
... etc ...
]
